- **Configuration Page** (`app/integrations/typefully/configure/page.tsx`)
  - API key management
  - Save/update configuration to database
  - Getting started instructions
  
- **Integration Card** (Updated `app/integrations/page.tsx`)
  - Added Typefully to the integrations grid
  - Categorized as "Social" integration

### 3. Server-Side Implementation (✅ Complete)
- **Typefully Client** (`lib/typefully.ts`)
  - API client for Typefully operations
  - Thread content generation from patch notes
  - Smart text splitting for Twitter's 280-character limit
  - Thread numbering and formatting

- **API Routes** (`app/api/patch-notes/[id]/queue-thread/route.ts`)
  - POST: Queue a new Twitter thread
  - GET: Check thread status
  - Video handling and attachment support
  - Error handling and job tracking

### 4. Patch Note Integration (✅ Complete)
- Updated `app/blog/[id]/page.tsx` to include:
  - "Queue Twitter Thread" button
  - Thread status checking
  - Automatic video generation prompt
  - Success/error feedback
  - Disabled state when thread is already queued

### 5. Documentation (✅ Complete)
- **Main README** updates with Typefully information
- **Detailed Guide** (`TYPEFULLY_INTEGRATION.md`)
  - Setup instructions
  - API limitations
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Best practices
  - Environment variables

### 6. Testing (✅ Complete)
- **E2E Tests** (`e2e/typefully-integration.spec.ts`)
  - Configuration flow testing
  - Thread queueing with mock data
  - Video generation integration
  - Error handling scenarios
  - CI-ready smoke tests
  
- **CI Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`)
  - Automated testing on push/PR
  - Playwright test execution
  - Artifact upload for test reports

### 7. Setup Utilities (✅ Complete)
- **Setup Script** (`scripts/setup-typefully.ts`)
  - Database table verification
  - Configuration status check
  - User guidance for next steps
  - Added npm script: `npm run setup:typefully`

## Key Features

### Thread Generation
- Automatic conversion of long patch notes to tweet threads
- Smart text splitting at sentence boundaries
- Thread numbering ([1/n], [2/n], etc.)
- Contributor acknowledgments
- Statistics and highlights extraction

### Video Integration
- Automatic prompt to generate video if missing
- Video attachment to first tweet
- Fallback handling if video generation fails

### Status Tracking
- Real-time job status updates
- Prevention of duplicate thread creation
- Visual feedback on button state
- Typefully draft URL display

## How to Use

### For Users
1. Run database migration:
   ```bash
   # Apply the Typefully tables migration
   supabase db push
   ```

2. Run setup script:
   ```bash
   npm run setup:typefully
   ```

3. Configure Typefully:
   - Go to `/integrations/typefully/configure`
   - Add your Typefully API key
   - Save configuration

4. Queue threads:
   - Navigate to any patch note
   - Click "Queue Twitter Thread"
   - Optionally generate video
   - View draft on Typefully

### For Developers
1. Run E2E tests:
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   npm run test:e2e
   
   # Run with UI
   npm run test:e2e:ui
   
   # Run in CI mode
   npm run test:e2e:ci
   ```

2. Test the integration:
   - Mock Typefully responses for local testing
   - Use Playwright tests for automated verification

## API Endpoints

### Queue Thread
```
POST /api/patch-notes/{id}/queue-thread
Body: {
  "scheduleFor": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z", // Optional
  "includeVideo": true // Optional
}
```

### Get Status
```
GET /api/patch-notes/{id}/queue-thread
Response: {
  "jobs": [...],
  "hasActiveJob": boolean
}
```

## Security Considerations
- API keys stored encrypted in database
- Server-side only API calls
- Rate limiting respect (60 req/min)
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Next Steps & Enhancements
Potential future improvements:
- [ ] Thread preview before queueing
- [ ] Custom scheduling UI
- [ ] Multiple Twitter account support
- [ ] Thread analytics integration
- [ ] Automatic hashtag suggestions
- [ ] Thread templates
- [ ] Bulk thread queueing
- [ ] Thread history and management UI

## Acceptance Criteria Status
✅ 1. Supabase migration creates `typefully_configs` and `typefully_jobs` tables
✅ 2. Integration UI lets users store credentials and view the Typefully card
✅ 3. Server-side helpers manage authentication, thread creation, and video upload
✅ 4. API route renders video via Remotion, queues thread, and records job metadata
✅ 5. Patch note detail page exposes "Queue Twitter thread" action with state feedback
✅ 6. Documentation covers environment variables, rendering requirements, and API limitations
✅ 7. Playwright E2E coverage exercises queueing a thread with mock video upload

## Issue Resolution
This implementation fully resolves GitHub issue #1 by:
- Implementing complete Typefully integration
- Supporting threaded posts with video uploads
- Providing comprehensive testing and documentation
- Following existing patterns (Resend integration) for consistency
- Including CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

The integration is production-ready and follows all specified requirements.
